# Conway's Game of Life Visualizer

Conway's Game is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway. Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) to learn more! This visualizer was written in JavaScript and I used an HTML 5 canvas for the grid. 

#### <u>Rules</u>

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
